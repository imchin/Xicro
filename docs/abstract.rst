Abstract
========

Nowadays, robotics software developers prefer to use Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) to manage robot data transmissions at the middleware level. In addition, the ROS developer community has created a tool called microROS, which is But due to the architecture required by the Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), microROS is only supported by microcontrollers that have enough resources for RTOS. The robot can use a microcontroller with ROS2 without the need for an RTOS. Coxsys Robotics and its researchers have developed the XICRO library as a communication tool between advanced software and robots. XICRO communicates through the ROS2 interface. XICRO libraries have been developed specifically for embedded systems, making efficient use of limited resources.
